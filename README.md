# stm32-baremetal-learning
Register-level bare-metal programming on STM32F103 (Blue Pill), documenting my learning process from GPIO to peripherals.

This repository documents my progress in learning register-level firmware development on the STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill).

The goal is to understand how peripherals work internally by programming them directly through memory-mapped registers — without using HAL or high-level abstraction layers.

MCU: STM32F103C8T6

Approach: Direct register manipulation
